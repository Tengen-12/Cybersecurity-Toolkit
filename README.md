# Cybersecurity Toolkit

---

## Overview
This toolkit consists of multiple Python scripts designed for security testing, reconnaissance, and vulnerability assessment.

---

## Tools and Features

### 1️⃣ API Testing (`API_Testing.py`)
- Tests API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
- Supports GET and POST requests with customizable headers.

### 2️⃣ API Finder (`API_Finder.py`)
- Identifies API endpoints from a given website.
- Uses web scraping and wordlist-based enumeration.

### 3️⃣ Domain & IP Finder (`Domain_IP_Finder.py`)
- Retrieves the IP address of a given domain.
- Performs WHOIS lookup and reverse DNS queries.

### 4️⃣ Header Detection (`Header Detection.py`)
- Scans HTTP headers for security misconfigurations.
- Identifies missing or weak security headers.

### 5️⃣ Scriptoit (`Scriptoit.py`)
- Automates script-based penetration testing tasks.
- Can be customized for exploitation scenarios.

### 6️⃣ URL Extractor (`URL extractor.py`)
- Extracts URLs from a given web page or document.
- Useful for phishing analysis and OSINT investigations.

### 7️⃣ Buffer Overflow Tester (`bufferoverlow.py`)
- Simulates buffer overflow attacks for vulnerability research.
- Helps identify memory corruption issues in applications.
