- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tengen-12
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding
- âš¡ Fun fact: there's no fun fact

- Here i provided 2 scripts for penetration testing.
  1. Header Detection by which you can find missing headers in particular website.
  2. Buffer Overflow by which you can send the overflow script through the open ports. This script first searches for the open port and then sends the payload script.
  
- Also these scripts are only for educational purposes does not support any mis-behave or unethical use.
- Use these scripts if you have written permission from the company and with proper consent.
